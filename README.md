# Computational marker for individual differences in non-reinforced learning
Codes and data published in the manuscript 'Computational marker for individual differences in non-reinforced learning' (temporary title), 2021
The data include: 
* Study 1 - meta-analysis of 29 CAT experiments
* Study 2 - two novel CAT design experiments (preliminary and a replication experiment) 

## instructions
In each Study directory, you will find R code with the main analysis. This code was used to make all analyses and figures included in the manuscript. To run the code yourself, make sure you download and install R, Rstudio and the list of packages used (listed in the first few lines of each script).
To download R package use `install.packages()`. 
The codes load information from the analysis directory and uses relative path, so it is recommended to download the entire content of the directory to run the code smoothly. Some lines will generate figures and tables, so it is recommended to run the analysis codes line by line (using Ctrl+Enter).
Within each directory, we also include the raw data (txt file format) from the different experiments. Study 2 also includes the Matlab codes used to run the experiments. The data is available for free for non-commercial academic purposes, but requires an appropriate reference. 
Feel free to contact us for more information.
